# DuelSim Future Development Paths

This directory contains plans, prototypes, and documentation for potential future development paths for DuelSim. Each subdirectory represents a different direction the project could take.

## Available Paths

### 1. Crypto Integration
Path for integrating cryptocurrency for betting, NFT fighters, and blockchain-based battle records.

### 2. Multiplayer Arena
Path for developing a multiplayer arena where players can spectate battles and place side bets.

### 3. AI Opponents
Path for creating advanced AI opponents with different fighting styles and personalities.

### 4. Enhanced Visuals
Path for upgrading visuals with more advanced terminal graphics or even a GUI interface.

### 5. Mobile App
Path for converting DuelSim into a mobile application.

## How to Use This Directory

Each subdirectory contains:
- A detailed README explaining the concept
- Prototype code or pseudocode
- Technical requirements
- Implementation roadmap
- Potential challenges and solutions

To explore a path, navigate to its directory and review the documentation.

## Contributing to Future Paths

If you have ideas for new development paths or want to contribute to existing ones:

1. Create a new directory for your path or choose an existing one
2. Add a detailed README explaining your concept
3. Include any prototype code or diagrams
4. Submit a pull request with your additions

We welcome all creative ideas for expanding DuelSim!

It looks like you've pasted an **HTTP request header**, likely captured from a browser request to `localhost:5555`. Here's what this header tells us, broken down into clear components for debugging, simulation, or backend emulation purposes:

---

### üßæ **Header Breakdown**

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Host** | `localhost:5555` ‚Äî the destination server (running locally on port 5555). |
| **Connection** | `keep-alive` ‚Äî keeps TCP connection open for multiple requests. |
| **Cache-Control** | `max-age=0` ‚Äî instructs not to use cached data; request fresh content. |
| **sec-ch-ua** | User Agent Client Hints ‚Äî browser info (`Edge 135`, `Chromium 135`). |
| **sec-ch-ua-mobile** | `?0` ‚Äî user is on a desktop, not a mobile device. |
| **sec-ch-ua-platform** | `"Windows"` ‚Äî OS platform of client. |
| **Upgrade-Insecure-Requests** | `1` ‚Äî client prefers HTTPS if possible. |
| **User-Agent** | Classic identifier string of browser/OS. |
| **Accept** | Content types accepted ‚Äî prioritizes HTML and images. |
| **Sec-Fetch-Site** | `cross-site` ‚Äî request originates from a different origin (likely an iframe or redirect). |
| **Sec-Fetch-Mode** | `navigate` ‚Äî full page load. |
| **Sec-Fetch-User** | `?1` ‚Äî user explicitly interacted (e.g., clicked a link). |
| **Sec-Fetch-Dest** | `document` ‚Äî requesting an HTML document. |
| **Accept-Encoding** | Supported content encodings: `gzip`, `br`, etc. |
| **Accept-Language** | English preference (`en-US`, fallback `en`). |

### üß† Use Cases for You

1. **Simulating Duel Interface Requests**
   - If you plan to create a **web-based duel front-end**, this request pattern is typical of how a browser might contact your backend logic core.
   - If you're testing combat replay feeds, leaderboard sync, or user state saving, these headers may come from your duel client front-end.

2. **Embedding the Tick-Based Engine in a Web Service**
   - You might spin up a `localhost:5555` HTTP server (in C, Go, Node.js) that wraps your C engine:
     - POST `/start-duel` with player data ‚Üí initializes engine state
     - GET `/tick` ‚Üí advances simulation 1 tick, returns combat log

3. **Debugging Cross-Origin/Dev Tools**
   - The `Sec-Fetch-*` headers are automatically added by modern browsers to detect CORS and security context. Useful if you build a JS or WebAssembly wrapper for your combat engine.

---

Would you like a minimal server stub (in C or Node.js) that wraps your tick logic and allows sending in duel config from a browser?

This way, your low-level "muscle" can power a high-level client anywhere.

---

Here‚Äôs a **minimal browser client** that pings your `/tick` endpoint on `localhost:5555`, displays duel logs in real-time, and lets you initialize the duel via button press.

You can serve this **as a static file** or just open it directly in your browser.

## üîß How to Use

1. **Start your duel server**:
   ```bash
   ./duel_server
   ```

2. **Open `index.html`** in your browser (just double-click it or open from VSCode Live Server, etc.)

3. **Click "Start Duel"** ‚Äî initializes the duel logic via `/start-duel`

4. **Click "Run Tick"** ‚Äî sends a GET to `/tick`, which processes 1 tick and returns a response string (e.g. `"Tick 3 executed"`)

---

## üß† Optional Enhancements (Next Steps)
If you want this to go hard:

- ‚è± Auto-tick every 600ms with a "Start Loop" / "Pause" toggle
- üß† Show current HP, cooldown, and action queue per player
- üìú Combat replay log (download as JSON or save via `localStorage`)
- üß± Animate basic 2D movement or attacks with JavaScript canvas or sprites

---

Let me know if you want:
- A full WebAssembly or Emscripten port of your C engine
- Multiplayer simulation logic over WebSocket
- AI agents that submit preloaded actions via UI

We can turn this tick engine into an empire.
