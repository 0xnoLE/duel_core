# DuelSim Crypto Integration

This path explores integrating cryptocurrency and blockchain technology into DuelSim to create a decentralized betting platform and NFT-based fighter marketplace.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Cryptocurrency Betting
- Allow users to place bets on duels using cryptocurrencies
- Smart contracts to automatically distribute winnings
- Betting pools for tournament-style competitions
- House takes a small percentage of each bet

### 2. NFT Fighters
- Fighters as unique NFTs with special attributes
- Tradable on NFT marketplaces
- Fighter stats and battle history stored on-chain
- Rare and legendary fighters with unique abilities

### 3. Blockchain Battle Records
- Permanent record of all battles on the blockchain
- Verifiable fight history and statistics
- Achievement badges as NFTs
- Tournament records and championships

### 4. Spectator Mode
- Live spectating of high-stakes battles
- Chat integration for spectators
- Ability to place side-bets during ongoing battles
- Replay famous battles from blockchain history

## Technical Requirements

- Web3 integration (Ethereum, Solana, or similar)
- Smart contract development
- Secure wallet integration
- NFT minting and management
- Real-time data feeds for live betting

## Blockchain Options

### Ethereum Integration
- Higher gas fees but wider adoption
- ERC-721 standard for NFTs
- Robust ecosystem of tools and services
- See `crypto_integration.py` for Ethereum implementation

### Solana Integration
- Lower fees and faster transactions
- SPL Token and Metaplex for NFTs
- Growing ecosystem with strong developer support
- See `solana_integration.py` for Solana implementation

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Basic Crypto Integration
- Add wallet connection functionality
- Implement simple betting mechanism
- Create basic fighter NFT structure
- Store battle results on-chain

### Phase 2: Enhanced Betting System
- Develop smart contracts for automated payouts
- Create betting pools for tournaments
- Implement side-betting during live battles
- Add odds calculation based on fighter statistics

### Phase 3: Full NFT Ecosystem
- Develop fighter marketplace
- Add breeding/fusion mechanics for fighters
- Create special equipment NFTs
- Implement fighter leveling and progression

### Phase 4: Community Features
- Spectator mode with chat
- Fighter leaderboards
- Tournament organization tools
- Guild/team system for collaborative play

## Prototype Code

```python
# Example code for wallet integration
from web3 import Web3
import json

class CryptoIntegration:
    def __init__(self, provider_url="http://localhost:8545"):
        self.web3 = Web3(Web3.HTTPProvider(provider_url))
        self.betting_contract = None
        self.nft_contract = None
        
    def connect_wallet(self, wallet_address):
        """Connect a user's wallet to the system"""
        if self.web3.isAddress(wallet_address):
            return {"success": True, "address": wallet_address}
        return {"success": False, "error": "Invalid wallet address"}
        
    def place_bet(self, wallet_address, fighter_id, amount, token="ETH"):
        """Place a bet on a fighter"""
        # Implementation would call smart contract
        pass
        
    def mint_fighter_nft(self, wallet_address, fighter_data):
        """Mint a new fighter as an NFT"""
        # Implementation would call NFT contract
        pass
        
    def record_battle_result(self, battle_data):
        """Record battle result on the blockchain"""
        # Implementation would store data on-chain
        pass
```

## Potential Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge: Gas Fees
**Solution:** Implement Layer 2 solutions or use Solana for lower fees

### Challenge: User Experience
**Solution:** Abstract away blockchain complexity with simple UI and wallet integration

### Challenge: Regulatory Concerns
**Solution:** Consult legal experts and implement KYC where necessary

### Challenge: Market Volatility
**Solution:** Allow stable coin betting options and implement price oracles
