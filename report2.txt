## Current Status

We've successfully implemented a robust WebSocket server and client architecture for the DuelSim game. The system now properly:

1. Establishes WebSocket connections between the server and clients
2. Handles the WebSocket protocol correctly (handshakes, framing, ping/pong)
3. Broadcasts battle events to all connected clients
4. Updates player information and battle state on the client side

## UI Issues and Solutions

The main issue we've been facing is that the UI doesn't consistently update when battle events occur. This appears to be due to several factors:

### 1. Event Type Inconsistencies

There are inconsistencies between the event types sent by the server and those expected by the clients:

- Server sends events with types like `'move'` but client code sometimes looks for `'movement'`
- Some event handlers expect `event.actor` while others look for `event.player`

**Solution**: We've standardized the event handling in both clients to properly process the events as they're sent from the server.

### 2. Arena Visualization Issues

The arena visualization wasn't updating correctly because:

- The `updateArena()` function wasn't being called consistently after state changes
- Player positions weren't being properly extracted from events

**Solution**: We've enhanced the event handling to ensure player positions are updated in the battle data and the arena is redrawn after each relevant event.

### 3. Health Bar Updates

Health bars weren't updating properly because:

- Health changes from attack events weren't being properly applied to the battle data
- The health bar visualization code wasn't being called after health changes

**Solution**: We've improved the attack event handling to correctly update player health and trigger UI updates.

## Architecture Considerations

The current architecture has some limitations:

1. **Server-Side Rendering vs. Client-Side Rendering**: The system is currently using client-side rendering, which is appropriate for this type of real-time application. Server-side rendering would introduce latency and complexity.

2. **Event-Driven Updates**: The system relies on events to trigger UI updates, which is efficient but requires careful synchronization between server events and client handlers.

3. **State Management**: Battle state is maintained on both server and client, which can lead to inconsistencies if not carefully managed.

## Recommendations for Further Improvement

1. **Unified Event Schema**: Create a formal schema for all event types to ensure consistency between server and client.

2. **State Synchronization**: Periodically send complete state updates from the server to ensure clients stay in sync.

3. **Debugging Tools**: Enhance the WebSocket debug page to allow testing specific event types and visualizing their effects.

4. **Animation Enhancements**: Add more visual feedback for actions like movement, attacks, and special abilities.

5. **Error Handling**: Improve error handling for network issues and unexpected events.

6. **Performance Optimization**: Minimize the size of messages sent over WebSocket by only including changed data.

## Conclusion

The WebSocket implementation is now functional and provides real-time updates to clients. The UI issues have been addressed by standardizing event handling and ensuring proper state updates. With the recommended improvements, the system will be more robust, maintainable, and visually engaging.

The current architecture is appropriate for a real-time game like DuelSim, and the client-side rendering approach allows for responsive updates without the latency that would be introduced by server-side rendering.
