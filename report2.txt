# Current Status of DuelSim Project

Looking at the code and the duel report you shared, I can see that your DuelSim project has made significant progress. Let's analyze the current state, successes, and issues:

## Successes

1. **Core Duel Simulation**: The battle engine is working well, as evidenced by the duel report showing a complete battle between "0xEC" and "noLE" with detailed statistics.

2. **Reporting System**: You have a nice reporting system that generates detailed battle narratives with statistics, damage dealt, critical hits, etc.

3. **Spectator Mode Framework**: You've implemented a spectator server that can broadcast duel events to connected clients.

4. **Web Interface**: You have HTML/JavaScript code for a web-based spectator interface.

5. **Betting System Integration**: You've started implementing a betting system that integrates with the spectator mode.

## Current Issues

1. **WebSocket Connection Problems**: It appears that the WebSocket connection between the browser and the spectator server isn't working correctly. This is likely due to:
   - Inconsistent port usage (5555, 5556, 5557) across different files
   - Possible issues with the WebSocket handshake implementation
   - HTML template issues in the `_handle_http_request` method

2. **HTML Template Error**: The line `html = """<!DOCTYPE html>...`.replace` is missing parentheses, which would cause a syntax error.

3. **Client Information Handling**: There might be issues with how client information is stored and updated when clients connect.

## Next Steps for Debugging

1. **Fix the HTML Template**: The most immediate issue is the syntax error in the HTML template:

```python
# Change this line:
html = """<!DOCTYPE html>...</html>""".replace

# To:
html = """<!DOCTYPE html>...</html>""".replace("{port}", str(self.port))
```

2. **Standardize Port Usage**: Make sure all references to WebSocket ports are consistent across files.

3. **Test with Simple WebSocket Client**: Use the `websocket_test.html` file to test basic WebSocket connectivity before trying the full spectator interface.

4. **Check Server Logs**: When running the server, look for any error messages related to WebSocket connections or HTTP requests.

5. **Verify WebSocket Handshake**: Make sure the WebSocket handshake is being performed correctly in the `_handle_http_request` method.

Would you like me to help with any specific part of the debugging process?
